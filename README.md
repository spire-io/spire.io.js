# Synopsis

`$.spire` is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin and wrapper library for the [spire.io API](http://www.spire.io/).

    $.spire.options.key = '<your account key>';

    $.spire.messages.subscribe('chat example', function(err, messages){
      $.each(messages, function(i, message){
        var p = $('<p>').text(message.content);

        $('body').append(p);
      });
    });

Construct a message to send, `message.content` can be a string or json object.

    var message = { channel: 'chat example'
        , content: 'herow'
        }
    ;

    $.spire.messages.publish(message, function(err, message){
      if (err) throw err; // you could do better ;)

      alert('message sent!');
    });

Or if you don't care that the message was sent

    $.spire.messages.publish(message);

## Working with this library

* [source code](https://github.com/spire-io/jquery.spire.js)

# Development

## Tests

CORs needs the html to on a server, to run the tests you need to run the test server and visit it's homepage. There is a helper in the Cakefile for this, run the test server via:

    cake test:server

If you don't know about cake and Cakefiles head on over to the CoffeeScript site (Don't worry this plugin isn't written in CoffeScript nor do you need it for anything other than running the development tasks)

## Bundle

So you made some changes and want to minify?
